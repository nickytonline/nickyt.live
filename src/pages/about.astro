    <h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Nick Taylor.</p>
<p>I'm a Developer Advocate who’s still very much an engineer at heart. I focus on empowering developers by building real solutions, sharing practical insights, and creating spaces where people can grow and succeed.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://pomerium.com">Pomerium</a>, I'm expanding into infrastructure and security, working hands-on with Zero Trust access, authentication, authorization policies, and cloud-native networking. I believe great DevRel starts by staying close to the code and grounded in real-world workflows.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nickytonline">I contribute to open source</a>, build technical demos, write deep-dive posts, <a href="https://nickyt.co`/talks">give talks</a>, and surface developer feedback — all to make developers more effective.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about growing inclusive communities, amplifying developer voices, and making complex technologies more accessible.</p>
<p>Areas of interest: infrastructure, security, open source, developer tooling, frontend ecosystems (especially React/JavaScript), and improving developer workflows.</p>
