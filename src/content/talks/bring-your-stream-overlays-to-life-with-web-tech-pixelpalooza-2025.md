Most stream overlays are static images or basic animations that just sit there looking pretty. But what if you treated them as web pages instead? You can build dynamic overlays using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that respond to your content in real-time.

We'll explore how to create overlays that go beyond static graphics, and if you're on Twitch, elements that actually respond to chat commands using ComfyJS.

In 10 minutes, you'll see how web technologies can transform your stream's visual layer from decorative afterthoughts into engaging, responsive experiences. Perfect for developers who want to apply their skills to streaming media in ways most people never consider.
