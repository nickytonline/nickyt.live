Fresh is a web framework based on Web standards built to run on the edge anywhere you can run Deno. Fresh takes inspiration from existing frameworks to provide features like file-based routing, Islands architecture, server-side rendering and Typescript. Another compelling reason to consider Fresh is that there is no build step.
