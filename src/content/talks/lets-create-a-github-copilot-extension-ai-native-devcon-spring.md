In this talk, Nick Taylor walks through building a GitHub Copilot extension from scratch using the [Copilot Extensions SDK](https://github.com/copilot-extensions/sdk) and [Hono.js](https://hono.dev/).

You'll learn:

- Best practices like payload validation, progress notifications, and error handling
- How to set up a development environment with port forwarding
- How to debug using the Node.js debugger

By the end, you'll have a working Copilot extension and a strong grasp of the tooling and techniques to create your own.
