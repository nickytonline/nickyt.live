Abstract: Get hands-on in this talk where we'll create a GitHub Copilot Extension from scratch.

We'll use the <a href="https://github.com/copilot-extensions/preview-sdk.js/">Copilot Extensions SDK</a>, and <a href="https://hono.dev">Hono.js</a>, covering best practices like payload validation and progress notifications and error handling.

We'll also go through how to set up a dev environment for debugging, including port forwarding to expose your extension during development as well as the Node.js debugger.

By the end, we'll have a working Copilot extension that the audience can try out live.
