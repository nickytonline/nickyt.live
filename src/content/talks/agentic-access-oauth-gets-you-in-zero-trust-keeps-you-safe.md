In this talk from the MCP Dev Summit - The Context sessions, Nick Taylor explains why traditional access controls fall short for LLM agents and autonomous tools, and how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) paired with Zero Trust architecture solves this. He outlines why VPNs and OAuth alone aren't enough, introduces identity-aware proxies as a core Zero Trust component, and demonstrates how Pomerium secures MCP servers and clients with context-aware, policy-driven access control.
