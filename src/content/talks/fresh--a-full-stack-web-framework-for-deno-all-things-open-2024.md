Fresh is a web framework based on Web standards built to run on the edge anywhere you can run Deno.

Fresh takes inspiration from existing frameworks to provide features like file-based routing, Islands architecture, server-side rendering and Typescript. Instead of React, it uses Preact.

We'll go through the features and architecture so that you can get up and running with Fresh today.
