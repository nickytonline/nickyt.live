We discuss the fundamentals of browser extensions (Chromium browsers & Firefox), explore the current options available for end-to-end testing, and dive in to some live coding to see it in action.

By the end of this presentation, you'll have the knowledge and skills to implement end-to-end testing for your own browser extension.
