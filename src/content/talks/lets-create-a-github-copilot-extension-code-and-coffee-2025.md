Get hands-on in this talk where we'll create a GitHub Copilot Extension from scratch. We'll use the Copilot Extensions SDK, explore best practices like payload validation, progress notifications and error handling. We'll also go through how to set up a dev environment for debugging, including port forwarding to expose your extension during development as well as the Node.js debugger.

By the end, we'll have a working Copilot extension that demonstrates how to extend GitHub Copilot's capabilities with custom functionality, allowing for integration with third-party services and accessing files and editor context.
