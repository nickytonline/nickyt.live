Virtual Coffee started as a once a week zoom chat in April 2020, and has grown into a community of devs at all stages of the journey, meeting, mentoring, hosting events, and most importantly, making friends. Our mission is to form community, allow room for growth and mentorship at all levels, and to provide a safe space for everyone interested in tech. Nick goes over conventional comments and how they can help you and your team.
