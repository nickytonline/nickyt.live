In this hands-on workshop, I walked through how to create a GitHub Copilot Extension from scratch. We explored GitHub’s AI-powered tool ecosystem, built a working extension together, and discussed how to integrate with third-party services to enhance developer workflows.

**What We Covered:**

- What GitHub Copilot is and how it works
- The purpose and structure of Copilot Extensions
- Key concepts for building your own extension
- Live coding: building, testing, and debugging an extension

**Workshop Highlights:**

- Using the [nickytonline/copilot-extension-workshop](https://github.com/nickytonline/copilot-extension-workshop) repo
- Local development setup and tunneling
- Creating and configuring a GitHub App
- Working with the Copilot Extensions Preview SDK
- Debugging and testing your extension

By the end of the session, participants had a fully functional Copilot Extension running in their own environments—with the tools and knowledge to build more complex, custom integrations.

This workshop is especially useful for:

- Developers curious about AI tooling
- Teams looking to customize GitHub Copilot
- Anyone exploring Copilot Extensions as a platform for developer tools
