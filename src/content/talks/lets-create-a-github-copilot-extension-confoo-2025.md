GitHub Copilot is everywhere. It's on GitHub.com, in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, GitHub Codespaces and more. Did you know you can extend Copilot?

In this hands on talk, you'll learn:

- the architecture of a Copilot extension
- how to leverage the Copilot extension preview SDK to build GitHub Copilot extensions
- how to build out your first Copilot extension

We'll wrap things up by taking a peek at a real world example.
