Nick broke down how to secure MCP servers with zero trust principles using an identity-aware proxy, drawing from real-world practices at Pomerium. He explained zero trust: authenticate and authorize every request with a policy engine. Highlighted the need for security postures that scale beyond VPNsâ€”especially when public AI agents (e.g. Claude, ChatGPT) access your MCP servers.
