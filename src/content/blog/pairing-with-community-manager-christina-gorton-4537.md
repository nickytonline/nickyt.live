On <time datetime="2021-04-14">March 14th</time>, DEV Community manager [Christina](https://dev.to/coffeecraftcode) joined me on the pairing stream to talk about Cypress and how we use it at Forem for end to end (E2E) testing.

### On this stream, we covered:

- What [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/) is
- The different moving parts of Cypress
- The anatomy of an E2E test in Cypress
- [cypress-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/cypress-testing-library/intro/).
- How and why you would want to create a [custom Cypress command](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands).
