It's fall and the leaves are starting to change here in Montreal, which allows me to use that analogy to say that I've started a new role!

I've always been a fan of open source and have had the privilege to be paid to work in open source since January 2020 ([I used to work at DEV!](https://dev.to/nickytonline/a-new-year-a-new-start-i-m-joining-the-dev-team-3ap0)). I've been a fan of all the stuff Brian Douglas (@bdougieyo) did at GitHub and what he and the team have been doing at OpenSauced.

With that, I'm super pumped to say that [I‚Äôve joined OpenSauced](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nickytonline_today-is-my-first-day-opensauced-im-looking-activity-7109549689242312704-g4_c)!

I completed my first week, hitting the ground running. I've already had some work merged and even wrote my first blog post for them!

I love all that we're doing at OpenSauced, and I'm super excited about all the work we're shipping. I'm also a fan of our highlights feature. Here's one of mine.
