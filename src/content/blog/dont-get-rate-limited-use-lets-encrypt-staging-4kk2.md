While getting [Pomerium Core](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium) set up this week, I ran into Let's Encrypt rate limits â€” hereâ€™s how using Let's Encrypt staging can save you time when setting up auto-provisioned certificates.

For context, I work at [Pomerium](https://www.pomerium.com/). This was part of a local demo stack I was building with Docker Compose. Pomerium is an identity-aware proxy (think of it as an application gateway) that secures access to your apps with built-in policy enforcement, SSO, microsegmentation etc. All the Zero Trust security goodies.

I had [autocert](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/get-started/fundamentals/core/production-certificates#how-autocert-works-with-pomerium) enabled for Pomerium in my config.yaml:

```yaml
autocert: true
```

### What is autocert?

[autocert](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/get-started/fundamentals/core/production-certificates#how-autocert-works-with-pomerium) is a Pomerium feature that automatically provisions and renews TLS certificates for your routes using [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
No manual cert management, no copying files around â€” just tell Pomerium to handle it and it will issue valid certificates on the fly.

This works greatâ€¦ until you accidentally annoy Letâ€™s Encrypt while testing.

## What happened

I was adding a few test routes (`verify.demo.maisonlab.dev`, `authenticate.demo.maisonlab.dev`, etc.) and restarting Pomerium repeatedly to tweak my config.

Then this showed up in the logs:

```json
HTTP 429 urn:ietf:params:acme:error:rateLimited - too many certificates (5) already issued for this exact set of domains in the last 168h0m0s
```

**Rate limited.** No more certs for `verify.demo.maisonlab.dev` for 7 days.

## Why this happened

First, I had the wrong volume path for the autocert cache:

```diff
services:
  pomerium:
    image: pomerium:mcp
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/pomerium/config.yaml:ro
-      - ./pomerium-cache:/pomerium/.cache
+      - ./pomerium-cache:/data/autocert
+      # this is where Pomerium stores autocert data
    networks:
      - pom-network

# ...
```

Without the correct cache volume, Pomerium wasnâ€™t persisting issued certs between Docker compose restarts. Each time I restarted the Pomerium container, it tried to re-request a new cert and Letâ€™s Encrypt counted every attempt.

Second, even _failed_ attempts count toward Letâ€™s Encryptâ€™s certificate provisioning quota. ðŸ« 

- [5 certificates per domain per week](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/#new-certificates-per-exact-set-of-domains).
- Once you hit the limit, youâ€™re stuck waiting 7 days for that domain.

## The fix: use staging while testing

If youâ€™re working on a new Pomerium setup, use Letâ€™s Encryptâ€™s **staging environment** while testing certificate provisioning:

```yaml
autocert: true
# autocert_ca defaults to https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
autocert_ca: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

See the [autocert_ca](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/autocert#autocert-ca) docs. When you point Pomerium at the staging certificate authority (CA):

- You can test your flow without worrying about production rate limits.
- The only catch: staging certs arenâ€™t trusted by browsers (youâ€™ll get a warning), but thatâ€™s fine for local testing.

Once your config is good and your cert cache is persisting properly, flip back to production by removing the `autocert_ca` line.

## TL;DR

If you see:

```json
HTTP 429 urn:ietf:params:acme:error:rateLimited
```

Youâ€™re in rate-limit jail for 7 days.

- Make sure your autocert volume is correct for the Pomerium container, i.e. (`/data/autocert`).
- Use [Letâ€™s Encrypt staging](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/) while testing.
- Flip back to production once youâ€™re happy.

**One last note:** This isnâ€™t a Pomerium-specific quirk. Itâ€™s how Letâ€™s Encryptâ€™s [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) work in general. If youâ€™re automating certificate issuance with any tool, the same caution applies when testing.

Hope this saves someone else a bit of time (and avoids a few unnecessary retries).
If youâ€™re building out your own Pomerium setup and hit this, now you know whatâ€™s going on. Also, if you're using Pomerium, hit me up! I'd love to know how you're using it or what issues you run into, if any.
