GitHub Copilot, the AI-powered coding assistant, has recently introduced [Copilot Extensions](https://github.com/features/copilot/extensions) to enhance its ecosystem. This feature, now in [public beta](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/enhancing-the-github-copilot-ecosystem-with-copilot-extensions-now-in-public-beta/), allows developers to create custom extensions that integrate with Copilot. In this blog post, we'll walk through the process of creating your first GitHub Copilot extension.

Before we begin, it's important to note that you need to have an active GitHub Copilot subscription to create and use Copilot extensions.

## Creating the Endpoint for Your Copilot Extension

A Copilot extension is essentially a GitHub app with a specific endpoint. Let's set up the project and create this endpoint, which together will form your Copilot extension.

### Setting Up Your Project

In this guide, we're using [Hono.js](https://hono.dev/) as our web framework, but you can use any web framework or web server of your choice.

{% embed "https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-story-of-web-framework-hono-from-the-creator-of-hono" %}

The core concepts will remain the same regardless of the framework you choose. The only thing to be aware of about the SDK is, for the moment, the only languages supported are TypeScript and JavaScript.

1. Create a new Hono project using the Hono CLI:

   ```bash
   npm create hono@latest
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set up your project. This will create a new TypeScript project using [Hono.js](https://hono.dev/), a lightweight and fast web framework.

2. Install the preview SDK for Copilot extensions and Octokit's core package:

   ```bash
   npm install @copilot-extensions/preview-sdk @octokit/core
   ```

   {% embed "https://github.com/copilot-extensions/preview-sdk.js" %}

3. Open your main file (e.g., `src/index.ts`) and let's start by importing the necessary dependencies:

   ```typescript
   import { Hono } from "hono";
   import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
   import { Octokit } from "@octokit/core";
   import {
     createAckEvent,
     createDoneEvent,
     createErrorsEvent,
     createTextEvent,
     getUserMessage,
     verifyAndParseRequest,
   } from "@copilot-extensions/preview-sdk";

   const app = new Hono();
   ```

### Implementing the Endpoint

Now, let's implement the endpoint that will handle requests from GitHub Copilot:

1. Create a root route that receives a form post, `/`. This is the endpoint that Copilot will interact with:

   ```typescript
   app.post("/", async (c) => {
     // ... (we'll fill this in next)
   });
   ```

2. When a message comes in, you need to verify the request and parse the payload:

   ```typescript
   // Identify the user, using the GitHub API token provided in the request headers.
   const tokenForUser = c.req.header("X-GitHub-Token") ?? "";
   const body = await c.req.text();
   const signature = c.req.header("github-public-key-signature") ?? "";
   const keyID = c.req.header("github-public-key-identifier") ?? "";

   const { isValidRequest, payload } = await verifyAndParseRequest(
     body,
     signature,
     keyID,
     {
       token: tokenForUser,
     },
   );

   if (!isValidRequest) {
     console.error("Request verification failed");
     c.header("Content-Type", "text/plain");
     c.status(401);
     c.text("Request could not be verified");
     return;
   }
   ```

3. After verifying the request, process the message and create a response. Here's a simple example that greets the user:

   ```typescript
   c.header("Content-Type", "text/html");
   c.header("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff");

   return stream(c, async (stream) => {
     try {
       // Let GitHub Copilot know we are doing something
       await stream.write(createAckEvent());

       const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: tokenForUser });
       const user = await octokit.request("GET /user");
       const prompt = getUserMessage(payload);

       await stream.write(
         createTextEvent(
           `Welcome ${user.data.login}! It looks like you asked the following question, "${prompt}". `,
         ),
       );

       await stream.write(
         createTextEvent(
           "This is a GitHub Copilot extension template, so it's up to you to decide what you want to implement to answer prompts.",
         ),
       );

       await stream.write(createDoneEvent());
     } catch (error) {
       await stream.write(
         createErrorsEvent([
           {
             type: "agent",
             message: error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error",
             code: "PROCESSING_ERROR",
             identifier: "processing_error",
           },
         ]),
       );
     }
   });
   ```

This example uses the GitHub Octokit package to get the user's login name and greets them. The `createTextEvent` function is used to create the response that GitHub Copilot will display. Note as well, we are streaming the response in so that we can send a signal to GitHub Copilot that something is happening, i.e. `createAckEvent()`. Acknowledging the event will updated the Copilot user interface to a spinning indicator that something is happening.

## Exposing Your Extension

To test your Copilot extension, you need to make it publicly accessible:

1. If using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), enable [port forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/port-forwarding). Note that the port is private by default, a good thing, but for our use case, we need to set it to public.

   ![Port forwarding tab in the bottom dock of VS Code](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_qacy00wwwnnlp82gb3p1.png)

1. Alternatively, use tools like [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-local-tunnel/) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose a public URL.

In the provided code, the server is set up to run on port 3000:

```typescript
const port = 3000;
console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);

serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port,
});
```

It's worth mentioning that this setup is great for testing, but once you're ready to make your extension public, you'll need to deploy the web app (which acts as the GitHub app) to a publicly accessible location.

## Creating a GitHub App

Create a new GitHub app on your personal account for testing purposes. Head to your settings page on GitHub, and at the bottom, to the left, click on the Developer Settings link. This will bring you to your GitHub apps. You can also directly navigate to your GitHub apps page at [https://github.com/settings/apps](https://github.com/settings/apps).

### General settings

1. Enter a GitHub App name, e.g. my copilot extension
1. Enter a URL for the homepage. This can be the same as the test URL for now.
1. Set the Callback URL (currently required). This can be the same as the test URL for now. Even if you're not using OAuth you still need to put a URL here. I'm told in future this may no longer be required.

   ![A new GitHub app's settings page](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_a0xtzyphncdddesh4aoj.png)

1. Disable webhooks if they're enabled.

   ![Webhooks settings section](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_7lwy83g0ranuuwkhkwt5.png)

1. Make sure the app is initially accessible only to you. You can enable it for everyone when you're ready to make your GitHub Copilot extension publicly available.

   ![GitHub app visibility setting of just you or everyone](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_gs52bzu3wx6or4824tdv.png)

1. Click the **Create GitHub App** button to create the GitHub app.

### Permissions & events settings

Next up, we'll need to configure permissions. We want to provide the bare minimum permissions for a Copilot extension to work.

![Permissions settings for a GitHub app](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_pcve43shvpcf3f29nb8h.png)

1. Expand the **Account permissions** sections and set the **Copilot Chat** permission to _read-only_. The default is _No access_.

   ![Account permissions section of a GitHub app](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_dy8k3t9hu2yeu1bhny0z.png)

1. Click **Save changes**. Don't be alarmed by the _Are you sure you want to update permissions?_ message.

   ![Save changes button](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_z84spjnhh0u8l793hgyx.png)

### Copilot settings

1. Set the **App Type** to _Agent_. It's set to _Disabled_ by default.
1. Set the **URL** to the root of the public URL you exposed via tunneling/port forwarding.

   ![A GitHub App's Copilot settings section](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_nsohzqzw3w6j8sjuv3ht.png)

1. Click Save.

Congratulations! You've configured your first Copilot extension!

## Testing Your Extension

You can test your Copilot extension in a few environments:

1. GitHub.com's Copilot chat
1. [VS Code's Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.VSGitHubCopilot)
1. [Visual Studio's Copilot Chat](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-chat?view=vs-2022)

For these environments, follow these steps:

1. In the GitHub Copilot chat, type "@" to see available extensions.

1. Your extension should appear as, e.g. "@my-copilot-extension".

   ![Copilot chat on GitHub.com displaying the available Copilot extensions](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_jjya7he52fm0gjf12e21.png)

   ![Copilot chat in Visual Studio Code displaying the available Copilot extensions](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_zgoskatjirgnercam1gk.png)

1. Select your extension and ask a question or perform an operation.

1. The Copilot extension will return a response of _Welcome your_github_username! It looks like you asked the following question, "your_question". This is a GitHub Copilot extension template, so it's up to you to decide what you want to implement to answer prompts._

   ![Copilot chat responding, "Welcome nickytonline! It looks like you asked the following question, "What is the most used programming language?". This is a GitHub Copilot extension template, so it's up to you to decide what you want to implement to answer prompts."](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_l5hcwm6zkx05iynjhp1x.png)

It won't respond to your specific question as that functionality has not been implemented. This is where you can explore the preview SDK or integrate with a third-party service to provide more meaningful responses.

## A Real-World Example

I've created a proof-of-concept (POC) Copilot extension for OpenSauced, where I work, that demonstrates these principles in action.

{% embed "https://github.com/nickytonline/open-sauced-copilot-ext-poc" %}

This extension utilizes [OpenSauced's StarSearch](https://opensauced.pizza/blog/open-source-insights-with-starsearch) feature to provide open-source insights directly within Copilot.

## Grab the GitHub Copilot Extension Template

If you're interested in starting your own GitHub Copilot Extension, I've created a template to help you get started quickly:

{% embed "https://github.com/nickytonline/copilot-extension-template" %}

This template provides a solid foundation for building your extension, incorporating best practices and a basic structure to build upon. The template uses the Hono.js Node.js server, but it's worth noting that Hono.js offers various adapters for different deployment environments. You can use adapters for platforms like Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, and more. For more information on Hono.js and its adapters, check out their [Getting Started guide](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/basic).

I also encourage you to take a peek at the examples in the copilot-extensions organization on GitHub, including some examples in the preview SDK:

{% embed "https://github.com/copilot-extensions" %}

These examples can provide inspiration and guidance as you develop your own extensions.
