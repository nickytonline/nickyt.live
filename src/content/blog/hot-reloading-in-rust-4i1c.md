I've been learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) on and off since last fall. I'm still not proficient in the language as I haven't dedicated as much time to the language as I'd like to. Still, I find pockets of time, like tonight, to dive in a bit.

A quick Google of "rust hot reloading" introduced me to the rust crate, [cargo-watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch). I installed it as per their instructions `cargo install cargo-watch`.

From there, I went into a rust project I'm working on and ran the following from the project's root from the command line, `cargo watch -x 'run'`.

And that was it! I was able to start up my program, and with every change, it reran automatically!

```bash
{% raw %}
[Finished running. Exit status: 101]
[Running 'cargo run']
   Compiling rusty v0.1.0
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.12s
     Running `target/debug/rusty`
["tobey maguire", "andrew garfield", "tom holland"]
[Finished running. Exit status: 0]

{% endraw %}
```
