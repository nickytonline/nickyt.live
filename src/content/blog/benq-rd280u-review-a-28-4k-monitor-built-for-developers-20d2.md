_BenQ sent me this monitor for review, but these are my honest thoughts after a few weeks of use._

After spending quality time with the [BenQ RD280U](https://benqurl.biz/4kZ3mRx), Iâ€™m genuinely impressed. The **3:2 aspect ratio** might seem unusual at first glance, but for programming and dev work, itâ€™s spot on. The extra vertical space is super practical â€” more lines of code visible at once, less scrolling, and a better overall reading flow.

I previously used a 27" flat monitor, then upgraded to a 34" ultrawide curved display, which I used for a few years. So youâ€™d think going down to a 28.2" screen would feel like a step back. But honestly, it didnâ€™t bother me at all. The RD280Uâ€™s 3:2 layout makes the space feel efficient and purpose-built for dev work. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m missing anything â€” if anything, it feels more focused.
**(That saidâ€¦ send me a second one, BenQ ðŸ‘€ðŸ˜…)**

### Unboxing & Setup

BenQ clearly put some thought into the packaging. Everything was neatly organized, secure, and easy to unpack. No fighting with twist ties or mystery compartments.

Setup was super straightforward â€” the base attaches to the stand with a single thumbscrew, and the monitor just clicks into place. No tools needed, and it only took a couple minutes.

One thoughtful touch I really appreciated is the **small leather strap with a snap button** on the stand. Itâ€™s a simple but clever addition for wrangling cables â€” perfect for keeping power and display cables neatly guided out of the way.

Hereâ€™s a quick look at the unboxing and setup process:

### Daily Use

This is actually my **first 4K monitor**, and wow â€” the **sharpness and colour clarity** are next level. Text looks razor crisp, which really makes a difference when you're staring at code for hours. Colours are super vivid without being overblown, and blacks are deep and rich, making dark themes pop without looking washed out.

You can connect to the RD280U via **HDMI**, **DisplayPort**, or **USB-C**. I opted for USB-C, and itâ€™s been great â€” it handles both video and charging for my laptop through a single cable.

The monitor is purpose-built for developers, and it shows. The **touch-sensitive function bar** lets you quickly switch between Coding Dark Theme, Coding Light Theme, and a custom colour mode. Combined with the **5-way controller**, you can fine-tune brightness, contrast, low blue light, and **Night Hours Protection** in seconds â€” no menu diving required.

**One of my favourite features** is the **MoonHalo light** on the back. I previously used the [BenQ ScreenBar Halo](https://pse.is/4mt8u9) on top of my old monitor â€” which I loved â€” but this built-in ambient light makes that extra bar unnecessary. The good news is, whoever gets the old monitor, they'll also be the lucky new owner of the Screenbar Halo. ðŸ˜Ž

The MoonHalo offers customizable brightness and colour temperature settings, as well as an auto-dimming mode that adjusts based on ambient light and screen brightness.

I personally prefer the **auto-dimming mode**, as it reacts to my environment, providing a subtle, eye-friendly glow that's perfect for evening sessions.

I opted for the version that includes the **stand** (not the swivel arm), and itâ€™s excellent. The stand feels sturdy and premium. You can easily adjust both **height and tilt**, which makes a big difference for ergonomics when you're coding for long stretches.

Also worth mentioning: the RD280U includes a **built-in KVM switch** â€” super handy if you regularly switch between devices. I havenâ€™t needed it yet, but Iâ€™m planning to set up a mini PC for some work-related software development, so Iâ€™ll probably make good use of it then.

### Final Thoughts

Overall, the RD280U hits the mark â€” itâ€™s a thoughtfully designed, dev-focused monitor that balances eye comfort, smart features, and beautiful screen real estate. If youâ€™re a developer looking to upgrade your setup, this oneâ€™s worth a serious look.
