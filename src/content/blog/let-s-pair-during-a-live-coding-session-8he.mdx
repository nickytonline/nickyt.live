I started live streaming a couple of months ago.

{% link "https://dev.to/nickytonline/i-ve-started-to-live-code-on-twitch-for-dev-13cn" %}

My goal was/is to stream actual stuff I'm working on at DEV. So far it's been fun. But you know what's more fun? Doing it with other people.

So far I've had a bunch of people sign up for the task. Here's a few takers. While you're at it, give them a follow on DEV and Twitter!

For the time being I plan to work on frontend issues only, but as things move along, I see this naturally progressing to any issue in the DEV repository.

If you are interested in participating. [Send me a DM on DEV](https://dev.to/connect/@nickytonline) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nickytonline). If you're not following me on DEV, you can still send me a message as my DMs are open.

Things to do to get you prepared for a live coding pairing session:

- [Visual Studio Code installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [Live Share extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack). This will allow us to work collaboratively in the editor. What's Live Share you ask? @lostintangent has a great series on it üòé

- DEV installed locally. Check out [docs.dev.to](https://docs.dev.to/installation/#installing-locally) to get up and running. If you have issues getting things installed, let me know and we can get it sorted for you.

- A decent Internet connection.

<b>Our first pairing session will be Wednesday, July 15th at 3 PM ET/7 PM UTC</b>.
