New year, new role!

Today is my first day at [Pomerium](https://pomerium.com). I'm joining the team as their Developer Advocate!

Working with the developer community is one of my favourite things to do, and I'll be able to continue to do that in my new role.

## Why Pomerium?

I'll be honest, I hadn't heard of Pomerium before interviewing with them. As their first Developer Advocate, part of my role will be to change that and put Pomerium on the map in the developer community.

What drew me to Pomerium was their innovative approach to [Zero Trust access control](https://www.pomerium.com/zero-trust). Their access proxy implements true Zero Trust principles, where every request is authenticated (authn) and authorized (authz) based on identity and context (device identity, device posture etc.) - regardless of where users or applications are located.

As a fan of open source, I love that they have an open core model which makes enterprise-grade Zero Trust access control available to everyone - from hobbyists all the way to enterprises.

The Pomerium team has been super welcoming, and I'm joining at an exciting time. Last summer, they launched [Pomerium Zero](https://www.pomerium.com/blog/introducing-pomerium-zero), their NextGen Access Platform for secure clientless connections, and [raised a $13.75M Series A](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240620782474/en/Pomerium-Announces-13.75M-Series-A-led-by-Benchmark-and-Launches-Pomerium-Zero) led by Benchmark.

## Wrapping Up

One last thing. I want to give big props to my network for reaching out, making intros etc. while I was looking for my next role. It was much appreciated, so thanks to all of you. You know who you are. ðŸ˜Ž

And also a big shoutout to Angie Jones, @techgirl1908, for taking time out of her super busy schedule to chat with me about Dev Rel and if it was a potentially good move for me. ðŸ’œ
