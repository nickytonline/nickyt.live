<p>Another week, another newsletter. Letâ€™s get to it!</p>
<h2>Around the Web</h2>
<ul>
<li>A great read on fine-grained reactive performance by Milo

</li>
<li>
<p>Kevin&rsquo;s videos are great and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3elGSZSWTbM&amp;utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-super-charge" target="_blank">Flexbox or grid - How to decide?</a> is another banger.</p>
</li>
</ul>
> &hellip;knowing the strengths of each one of them lets you go down the happy path, go down the path of least resistance&hellip;&rdquo; - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-super-charge" target="_blank">Kevin Powell</a>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A great write up from Dr. Axel Rauschmayer about the <a href="https://2ality.com/2022/11/array-from-async.html?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-super-charge" target="_blank">Array.fromAsync()</a> proposal. The <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-from-async?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-super-charge" target="_blank">proposal</a> is currently at stage 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/addyosmani_debugging-tactics-activity-7003411342632124416-mvUC?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-super-charge" target="_blank">advice from Addy about debugging</a>. Strong co-sign on all this. I&rsquo;d also add sometimes, just call it a day and sleep on it. Not always, but many times after doing this, coming in with a fresh head has unblocked me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>This cracked me up. Taika in general cracks me up. I was also in stitches after watching Thor: Ragnarok as well as Thor: Love &amp; Thunder. If you&rsquo;re reading this Bekah, I know <a href="https://twitter.com/BekahHW/status/1595956354535112704?s=20&amp;t=liNmUYge1r3S9px2HurPqA&amp;utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-super-charge" target="_blank">you&rsquo;re not a fan of Thor 4</a>, but I still appreciate you even though you&rsquo;re wrong lol. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
<p>And with that, I give you <a href="https://youtu.be/yRUtyCzfuI0?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-super-charge" target="_blank">Taika Waititi reads a hilarious letter about a speeding ticket</a>.</p>
<h2>Words of Wisdom for the Week</h2>

<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>
<p>I got to hang with Will Johnson last week where <a href="https://youtu.be/wZgrqN3d7WM?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-super-charge" target="_blank">he explained what Auth0 Actions are</a>. We even built out an integration with Slack where when someone creates an account in an app using Auth0, we could use a post user registration Auth0 Action to post a message in Slack.</p>

<p>Emmett Naughton joined me last week as well to discuss the job hunt. From working in an ER to landing in tech. Loved this discussion!</p>

<p>I also got this video up from the stream with Omar Mashaal. We chatted all about <a href="http://ultrajs.dev?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-super-charge" target="_blank">Ultra</a>, a modern web framework built for Deno that leverages web standards and the React paradigm.</p>

<p>And one last thing lol. I normally don&rsquo;t have this many shameless plugs but I&rsquo;ve been busy. ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be giving a virtual talk at the Chicago JS meetup this Tuesday talking all about <a href="https://fresh.deno.dev?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-super-charge" target="_blank">Fresh</a>, a new full-stack web framework that runs on <a href="https://deno.land?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-super-charge" target="_blank">Deno</a>. Come hang if that&rsquo;s your jam. The fun starts at 11:30 UTC (5:30 pm CT, 6:30 pm Eastern)</p>
