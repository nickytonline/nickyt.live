I'm starting a new role soon, and they shipped me a brand new Macbook Pro.

I got everything set up on my Mac over the past few weeks, but today I got a prompt about wanting to confirm the deletion of a file. I used the keyboard like I did on my previous Mac and realized it didn't work. I clearly had forgotten to adjust some settings on my new MacBook. Sure, I can use the mouse, but I had been so used to the keyboard for this.

All right, we need to head on over to our Keyboard settings.

See that checkbox labelled `Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls`? You're going to want to check that.

And you're done! Now you can use the keyboard for things like confirmation dialogs.
