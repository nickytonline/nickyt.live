We're excited to announce version 0.29.0 of Pomerium. If you haven’t heard of us, we’re a zero-trust identity-aware proxy.

In this release, there's a slick new Routes Portal that shows users exactly what they can access, UDP tunneling for protocols like DNS and VoIP, and HTTP/3 support for faster connections.

We've completely revamped tracing with OpenTelemetry, added direct Azure AD token authentication, and made JWT handling smarter when dealing with large group memberships.

Infrastructure fans: we now have a full Terraform provider for Enterprise!

Check out our announcement post for all the details, and let us know what you think!
