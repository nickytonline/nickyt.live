Not gonna lie, 2024 was a wild ride.

## OpenSauced

Starting 2024 was my fourth month at [OpenSauced](https://opensauced.pizza/). We went full tilt with feature development. The team was crushing it, and we shipped and shipped.

In April, we had our offsite in Miami which was awesome, and my CEO @bdougieyo was giving a talk at React Miami, so we all got to hang at React Miami as well. Lots of fun and it was so great hanging with the team for the week.

Here are a few pics from React Miami. What a great conference.

Coming off the heals of React Miami, we had a really [successful Product Hunt Launch too for StarSearch](https://www.producthunt.com/products/opensauced#starsearch).

We kept on shipping and eventually, [we got acquired by the Linux Foundation](https://opensauced.pizza/blog/opensauced-is-joining-the-linux-foundation).

Unfortunately, me and several others didn't make it along for the ride. Was I bummed out? Definitely, but after a few weeks, I got out of my slump, and started looking for my next role. More on that later.

A few things stand out for me at OpenSauced. One, it's the best team I've ever worked with. Shoutouts to bdougie, @jpmcb, @brandontroberts, @zeucapua, @bekahhw, @isabensusan and Chris. We were a small but mighty team.

I'm also really proud of all the things I shipped, and I still love this stat. I removed more code than I added while still shipping so much.

## Conference Speaking

In February, I gave my first in-person conference talk, two in fact at [Confoo](https://confoo.ca). Prior to this I had given several virtual conference talks.

Fall got really interesting - ended up giving two conference talks. Dove into HTML forms at Netlify Compose in early October.

It was also my first time to get to actually hang out in San Francisco. Big ups to the hype crew!

I also got to meet up with Bdougie for drinks and good food. It was great just hanging one on one.

In late October, I had the privilege of attending my first [All Things Open conference](https://allthingsopen.org/events/all-things-open-2024) in North Carolina and also gave a talk about Fresh (the Deno framework)!

There are more pics, but at the risk of flooding this post with all of them, just go check out the [#AllThingsOpen hashtag on X](https://x.com/hashtag/AllThingsOpen).

Both in person conferences were outstanding, and it was so great hanging with new and old friends.

## The Big Change

Then came the curveball: Linux Foundation acquired us, as I mentioned up top. Great news for the company, but a bunch of us didn't come along for the ride. I'm still really proud of all of us to making this happen. Even though I was bummed out about this initially, I got out of my mini funk and started the job hunt.

Job hunting in tech right now is... something else. Cold applications were mostly crickets, but my network really came through with interview opportunities. As the year wraps up, I'm in final rounds with some promising companies - fingers crossed for early 2025.

One thing that has been really great about all this is I've been enjoying the time off. I've been doing some contract work to cure my boredom as I work on landing my next role, but it's been a really great and much needed break for me.

## Community and Content

Even with all the career stuff, I kept contributing to the community. Wrote a bunch of blog posts - my GitHub Copilot extension piece really took off.

<Embed url="https://dev.to/nickytonline/creating-your-first-github-copilot-extension-a-step-by-step-guide-28g0" />

That led to creating a template repo and even getting invited to GitHub's Open Source Friday stream to talk about it.

## Looking Forward

Looking back, 2024 definitely didn't go exactly as planned, but nothing is certain these days. The tech world keeps changing and you just gotta roll with it. Excited to see what 2025 brings - I've got a feeling it's gonna be good.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
