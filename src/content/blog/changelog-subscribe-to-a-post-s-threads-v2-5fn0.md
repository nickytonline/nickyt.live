You could already subscribe to a post's comments on DEV, but the problem was many community members were not aware that you could. We had this feature pretty well hidden. From a post page, you had to click on the three dots to see a post's comment subscription options.

With the new comment subscription component, comment subscriptions are front and center in the discussion area of a post.

All the existing functionality still exists, it's just easier to find. ðŸ˜„ You can subscribe to all comments, top comments, author comments or unsubscribe.
