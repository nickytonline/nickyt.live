So here‚Äôs my 2018 Resolutions.{% link "https://dev.to/nickytonline/2018-resolutions-1deo" %}Did I complete them all? No, but honestly it‚Äôs not a big deal.

- _Continue to contribute to open source_: Mission accomplished üöÄ. I continued to be a collaborator on [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) and contributed some work there this year, fielded some issues etc.

{% github "https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot" %}

My other focus was the dev.to repository.

{% github "https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to" %}

I was accepted as an early contributor before the [project went open source](https://dev.to/ben/devto-is-now-open-source-5n1) and continued to contribute after it went public. It felt really good to be the [first contributor outside of the core team](https://dev.to/jess/dev-monthly-report--march-2018-579p) to have a PR merged.</p>

Although I didn‚Äôt contribute to TypeScript or VS Code, I‚Äôm still very happy with this year‚Äôs contributions.

- _Keep on blogging_: I continued to blog with a few blog posts and lots more short posts/comments on dev.to. People seemed to like ‚ÄúMy Mac Setup‚Äù which was one of the most popular posts for mid-January on dev.to.{% link "https://dev.to/nickytonline/my-mac-setup-2m05" %}{% link "https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/the-7-most-popular-dev-posts-from-the-past-week-4pno" %}
  Work and life got busy so not as much blogging as I‚Äôd had hoped.

- _Start making stuff on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io)_: Prior to 2018, I had never made any. I made a few to have a bit of fun, but I didn‚Äôt maintain this.

- _Read everything in my Pocket_: This just didn‚Äôt happen. In fact shortly after writing my 2018 resolutions, I stopped reading Pocket completely. It had nothing to do with the product, just got busy and when you add to Pocket, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs just sent up in the ether.{% twitter "1078703891364134912" %}
  Having said that, I highly recommend this tool for offline reading. I‚Äôm gonna try and catch up on some reading while I head away to a chalet for a few days.

- _Read [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://leanpub.com/fljs)_: I got through about a third of it, and well, no excuses üôÉ. Will have to finish this this year I guess üòâ

It‚Äôs fun making resolutions, but honestly, I did not lose any sleep over not completing some of these. Aside from resolutions, it was a busy year in work land and in the fall I decided to move on to an amazing role at Autodesk on the [Shotgun team](https://www.shotgunsoftware.com).

Prior to starting work, I attended a week long conference with the whole team. We‚Äôre distributed, so they try to have these team conferences once or every two years. As a brand new employee who hadn‚Äôt even started work yet, it was amazing to meet, wine/dine with my future co-workers and work on ways to improve the product. I‚Äôve been loving it since day 1. Great work/life balance and all the good things you look for in a job. üíØ

Aside from the new gig, I'm about to pass 12000 followers on dev.to! üî•

So as we close off 2018, I just want to say thanks to the dev.to core team and the community. You're all great.
