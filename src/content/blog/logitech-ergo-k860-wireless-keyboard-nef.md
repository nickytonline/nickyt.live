I started a new role at the beginning of April, and they ship you equipment, including a new keyboard and mouse. We were given a stipend, but there was a recommended option. I decided to go with the recommended option, the [Logitech Wireless ERGO K860 keyboard](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/products/keyboards/k860-split-ergonomic.920-009166.html).

## Software

You can modify what some of the keys do, e.g. F1-F12 keys. You can change what they do so; for example, the F12 key can act like an F12 key, or it could be the volume up key (default). What's nice, though, is you can also choose to open an application.

There are more options if you click on the More link.

## The Keyboard

### The Keys

The keys are low profile but have a nice tactile feel to them. It's not a clickety-clack loud keyboard which I appreciate. They seem pretty durable; I've only had the keyboard for a couple of months, so time will tell.

The only thing that annoys me about the keyboard is the <kbd>Print Screen</kbd> key position. It's directly above the <kbd>backspace</kbd>. I'm constantly taking random screenshots of my desktop because of where it's located.

To avoid constantly print screening you can use the LogiOptions to remap this key. I decide to remap it to the <kbd>backspace</kbd> key as that's the only time I press the <kbd>Print Screen</kbd> key.

### Comfort

The software is a nice touch, but the big thing I love about this keyboard is it's so comfortable on my hands and wrists. Aside from Apple keyboards, I've always had little feet at the front to raise the keyboard, which adds strain to your wrists. This keyboard flips where the feet are, to the front, causing a downward slope which is more comfortable on the wrists. The foot placement, mini-split at the center of the keyboard, and convex shape make it much more comfortable. There's also an integrated cushioned wrist pad which adds to the comfort. It can't be removed to clean or replace, so that's a potential downside.

### Ways to Connect

This is the first time I have a keyboard that can connect with a USB dongle or Bluetooth. I've had USB dongle or Bluetooth keyboards, but never the option for both. Since I've owned Macs, I had Apple keyboards, all Bluetooth before this keyboard. I thought I would have to use the USB dongle, so I was pleasantly surprised that it was Bluetooth.

Another cool thing about the Bluetooth support is you can pair the keyboard with up to three devices. This is not something I use often, but it was handy when moving from my old computer and my new work laptop.

### The Look

If you're looking for a keyboard that stands out visually, this is not that, but it has a sleek dark grey look which definitely doesn't look terrible.
