As I was going through my Twitter feed earlier this evening, a tweet from someone I follow popped up.

I was like, hey, that looks pretty cool. So I asked Steven if he had created it, to which he replied.

In a nutshell, typescript-play is like the official TypeScript playground but with some great enhancements:

- All strict options turned on by default
- More available compiler options
- Ability to switch TypeScript version
- More space for code
- More examples
- Quicker sharing, URL updates as you type
- Shorter sharing URLs

What's even cooler is the fact that it's open sourced, so you can deploy it locally.

If you don't feel like cloning it, check it out at [typescript-play.js.org](https://typescript-play.js.org).

Happy coding!
