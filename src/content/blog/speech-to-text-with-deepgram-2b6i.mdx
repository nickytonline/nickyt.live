Bekah Hawrot Weigel (@bekahhw) joined me on [my stream](https://livecoding.ca) today to show how you can transcribe text using Deepgram's [Node.js SDK](https://developers.deepgram.com/sdks-tools/sdks/node-sdk/).

We went through the demo code all the way to building out an app with Express that allows you to submit a URL for transcription.

Here's the code for what we built out
