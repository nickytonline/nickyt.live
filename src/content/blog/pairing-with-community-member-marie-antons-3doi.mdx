On October 22nd, DEV Community member Marie Antons joined Christina and I on the pairing stream to work on improving the Twitch liquid tag.

Aside from code, we talked about culinary school, and some embarrassing things that happened to me. ðŸ¤£

While Marie and I didn't get a chance to start working on the actual issue of podcast validation live, we did discuss what liquid tags are, how to create a podcast on Forem, and debugging my local environment.

After walking through these concepts together, Marie is now able to start working on the issue!
