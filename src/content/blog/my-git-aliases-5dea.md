Alright, so @philnash [roped me into this one](https://dev.to/philnash/comment/518o).

This post‚Äôs birth comes from [a gist](https://gist.github.com/nickytonline/128d7d164d1eea5daba6753ed0829f41#file-gitconfig) which is essentially a copy paste of my git aliases.

I‚Äôm going to provide my list of git aliases and explain what each alias does, plain and simple. Let‚Äôs get started! üèÅ For those new to git aliases, please see the [defacto docs on aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases). In a nutshell though, to create your own aliases, use the following git command.

```bash
{% raw %}
git config --global alias.somealias some-git-command
{% endraw %}
```

Before we get started, why git aliases? Well for one thing, I don‚Äôt know about you, but some git commands are hard to remember and also, we‚Äôre programmers, which means we‚Äôre lazy by default to be efficient. üê¢ ‚Äî\> üêá

- `a = add .` ‚Äî Running `git add` will add all files that have changed as staged.
- `b = branch` ‚Äî Lists all branches for your repository on your local machine.
- `bi = bisect` ‚Äî Running `git bi` will run git‚Äôs [bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) to help you figure out which commit has a bug.
- `ci = commit -m` ‚Äî This will commit a file with the message you specify, e.g. `git ci "awesome commit!"`.
- `co = checkout` ‚Äî This will checkout the branch you specify, e.g. `git co my-awesome-branch`
- `colast = checkout -` ‚Äî Running `git colast` will checkout the previous branch you were working in.
- `db = branch -D` ‚Äî This will delete the branch you specify, e.g. `git db my-not-so-awesome-branch`. Note that this will only work if the branch you‚Äôre deleting is not the one you‚Äôre currently working in.
- `laf = fsck --lost-found` ‚Äî Running `git laf` will bring you to [git‚Äôs lost and found](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-lost-found). I‚Äôll admit that I rarely use this, so perhaps it doesn‚Äôt warrant an alias and just some professional Googling.
- `last = log -1 HEAD` ‚Äî Running `git last` will show you what your last commit was.
- `lc = diff HEAD^ HEAD` - Compares the head of your branch to the previous commit.
- `pf = push --force-with-lease` ‚Äî Running `git pf` forces a push, but it is a little less destructive than forcing a push. See here for more info on [‚Äîforce-with-lease vs. ‚Äîforce](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease).
- `psu = push --set-upstream` ‚Äî Run this when you want to push a branch for the first time to the remote (typically `origin`), e.g. `git psu origin my-awesome-branch`.
- `pr = pull --rebase` ‚Äî This will rebase your current branch with the branch specified, e.g. `git pr develop`.
- `ra = rebase --abort` ‚Äî Running `git ra` will abort a [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase). Run this when you‚Äôre like, my rebase is currently messed up. Get me outta here!
- `rc = rebase --continue` ‚Äî Running `git rc` will continue a [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase). You typically run this when you‚Äôve handled any conflicts in a rebase.
- `remotes = remote -v` ‚Äî Running `git remotes` shows all the remotes currently configured for a repository.
- `renb = branch -m` ‚Äî When you want to rename a branch, run e.g. `git renb my-awesom-branch my-awesome-branch`.
- `rhh = reset --hard HEAD` ‚Äî The nuclear option. Run `git rhh` to wipe out all your changes and start from the `HEAD`.
- `rh = reset --hard` ‚Äî When you specify what to reset to, a hard reset is performed, e.g. `git rh HEAD~2`.
- `sfc = diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r` ‚Äî Shows files (relative file paths) for a specific commit, e.g.

```bash
{% raw %}
‚ùØ git sfc HEAD
src/posts/any-contribution-to-open-source-is-valuable-57d3.md
src/posts/april-16th-2021-what-did-you-learn-this-week-3e72.md
src/posts/are-there-plans-for-reviewers-of-articles-we-post--42nf.md
{% endraw %}
```

- `s = status -s` ‚Äî Running `git s` will give you a more terse [status](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status). Instead of this

```bash
{% raw %}
On branch post/my-git-aliases
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/post/my-git-aliases'.

Changes not staged for commit:
 (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
 (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

       modified: src/pages/articles/2018-08-24-my-git-aliases/index.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
{% endraw %}
```

You get this

```bash
{% raw %}
M src/pages/articles/2018-08-24-my-git-aliases/index.md
{% endraw %}
```

- `stashes = stash list` ‚Äî Running `git stashes` shows you all the stashes you have from [stashing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing). e.g.

```bash
{% raw %}
stash@{0}: WIP on upgrade: bff6257 Destructuring OCD...
stash@{1}: WIP on upgrade: 3d73199 Fixed LiceCap link.
stash@{2}: WIP on upgrade: c2f78g6 Update default title.
{% endraw %}
```

- `unstash = stash pop` ‚Äî Running `git unstash` pops a stash off the list of saved stashes.
- `vc = clean -dfx` ‚Äî Running `git vc` cleans your git repository, so anything not in git is wiped, e.g. `node_modules`, settings files which aren‚Äôt supposed to be in a repo etc. So BEWARE before you run this.
- `mend = commit --amend` ‚Äî Running `git mend` lets you amend a commit.
- `trigger = commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Build"` ‚Äî Creates an empty commit. This is handy when you need to restart a build remotely in your CI/CD pipeline without committing changes.
- `alias = ! git config --get-regexp ^alias\. | sed -e s/^alias\.// -e s/\ /\ =\ /` ‚Äî Running `git aliases` will show all the aliases you have configured globally in git.

Although it's not Git aliases, I also highly recommend using the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com).
