If you aren’t a [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) user, definitely check it out. I was a fan of Alfred for years, but moved to Raycast a few years ago. If you’re a Windows user, good news! They’re working on a Windows version. [Join the waitlist](https://www.raycast.com/windows).

If you’re doing any kind of web development the [Port Manager extension](https://www.raycast.com/lucaschultz/port-manager?utm_source=one-tip-a-week.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=one-tip-a-week-the-raycast-port-manager-extension) is a great tool to have. Once installed, just launch Raycast and type "port" or "port manager" to access these super useful commands:

- Open Ports - see what's currently running
- Kill Process Listening On - stop those pesky conflicting ports
- Open Ports in Menu Bar - quick access from your menu bar (I don’t really use this, but it ships with the extension)
- Named Ports - Name ports to make them easier to find in the open port list

Sure, you can do all this via terminal commands, but having it right at your fingertips in Raycast is way faster and more convenient.
