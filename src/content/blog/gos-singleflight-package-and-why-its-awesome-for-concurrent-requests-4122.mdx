Concurrency in Go is funâ€¦ until duplicate work starts hammering your backend.

Iâ€™m still pretty new to Go, but thanks to my awesome crew at [Pomerium](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium), Iâ€™ve been learning fast by jumping into real-world code.

One recent pull request (PR) from my teammate Caleb really made this click. He introduced me to `singleflight`, a super handy tool for avoiding redundant work in concurrent code.

Imagine a burst of requests with the same [Identity Provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider) (IdP) token. Without coordination, each request would separately validate and create a session â€” wasting resources and hitting downstream systems hard.

In the pull request, Caleb solved that by wrapping session creation in `singleflight`. This ensures only one validation runs at a time, and all callers share the result. Much more efficient.

At first, I thought this was [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization), but `singleflight` is built specifically for **concurrent deduplication**, not long-term caching.

## What is `singleflight`?

`singleflight` prevents duplicate work when many goroutines make the same request simultaneously.  
Think of it like short-lived memoization: only concurrent calls are deduplicated. Once the result is returned, itâ€™s gone â€” no persistent cache.

Itâ€™s perfect when you want to:

- Avoid request storms (e.g. validating the same token 100 times).
- Reduce load on databases or APIs.
- Provide consistent results during concurrency spikes.

## How it works

- **Deduplicates concurrent calls**: Goroutines calling `Do()` with the same key â†’ only one runs.
- **Shares results**: All callers get the same result (including errors).
- **Cleans up automatically**: Once done, the entry is removed.
- **Works per key**: Different keys are isolated.

## Real-world example

In Caleb's PR, `singleflight` makes sure only one session gets created when a lot of requests hit at once with the same token.

```go
res, err, _ := c.singleflight.Do(sessionID, func() (any, error) {
    // Try to get existing session
    s, err := c.getSession(ctx, sessionID)
    if err == nil {
        return s, nil // Found existing session
    } else if !storage.IsNotFound(err) {
        return nil, err
    }

    // No existing session â†’ create new one
    // Verify token and make API calls...

    err = c.putSessionAndUser(ctx, s, u)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("error saving session and user: %w", err)
    }

    return s, nil
})
```

No matter how many concurrent requests hit, only one runs the logic.

## Why use `singleflight`

- **Prevent verification storms**: One verification instead of dozens.
- **Reduce database/API load**: No redundant work.
- **Return consistent results**: All callers see the same outcome.

`singleflight` vs memoization

Memoization caches results across time. `singleflight` only deduplicates concurrent calls.

| Memoization            | `singleflight`                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Long-term cache        | Only during concurrent calls    |
| Needs eviction/TTL     | No expiry needed                |
| Speeds up future calls | Avoids duplicate work right now |

## Final thoughts

`singleflight` is one of those elegant Go utilities that quietly solves a tough problem. When youâ€™re dealing with concurrency and donâ€™t want the hassle of caching or locking, itâ€™s the perfect tool.

Iâ€™m still early in my Go journey, so running into patterns like this feels exciting. If you know other handy concurrency tricks (especially for someone coming from JS/C#/React land), drop them in the comments. I'm always down to learn ðŸš€
