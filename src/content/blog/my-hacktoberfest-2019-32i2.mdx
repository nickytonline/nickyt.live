Like many of you, I am participating in Hacktoberfest as well. Most of the contributions I have made in October have been for DEV. Here are the PRs that have been merged so far:

{% github "https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/pull/4257" %}

{% github "https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/pull/4323" %}

{% github "https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/pull/4346" %}

{% github "https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/pull/4374" %}

The other PR that ~~is still under review~~ got merged is for the [learnstorybook.com](https://learnstorybook.com) website.

{% github "https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook.com" %}

The PR adds a precommit hook to format markdown files via prettier and as well, I ran prettier on all the markdown files as a lot of files had not run through prettier previously.

{% github "https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook.com/pull/181" %}

Although this is not from Hacktoberfest, the beauty of open source is that anyone can checkout what you are up to. I was super surprised and felt pretty good when Addy Osmani liked one of my PRs for DEV.

I will probably contribute some more to the DEV codebase, but who knows, I may tackle an issue in another repository. YOLO.
