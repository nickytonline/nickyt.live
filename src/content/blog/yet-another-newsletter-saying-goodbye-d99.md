This will be a short one. I've decided to shut down this newsletter. It's been fun gathering stuff I find interesting on a weekly basis, but it also takes time sometimes, and the newsletter hasn't really grown like I thought it would.

Having said that, I do want to thank all of you who have subscribed over the past couple of years.

It's not all doom and gloom, though. I'm going to be putting more of my energy into my live stream, [nickyt.live](https://nickyt.live) if you weren't aware, as well as what, I think, might be a bit more unique in terms of a newsletter/video shorts, [OneTipAWeek.com](https://onetipaweek.com). I'm pretty busy with work and streaming atm, so not sure when I will start OneTipAWeek.com, but you are welcome to [subscribe](https://onetipaweek.com/subscribe).

Thanks, peeps!
