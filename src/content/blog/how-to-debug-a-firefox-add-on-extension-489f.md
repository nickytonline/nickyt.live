## Before we get started

Firefox supports browser extensions like Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge etc.). Sometimes they’re referred to as add-ons in Firefox land.

This post assumes that you are debugging a browser extension you are building, i.e. have the source code for and can build it locally.

It’s also assumed that the Firefox add-on has been built, i.e. generated the files, including a manifest for the add-on to work.

The following instructions work for [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) and [Firefox Deveoper Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/developer/).

## Setup Firefox for debugging an add-on

1. Open the browser DevTools and click on the three dots button, then select settings.

1. Scroll down to the Advanced Settings section and ensure _Enable browser chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes_ is checked.

1. Ensure you built the extension with the changes in my branch by running `npm run build`

1. Click on the _Load Temporary Add-on.._. button

1. Select the manifest file of the add-on from the OS file menu and click the _Open_ button.

1. The extension is now ready for use.

   ![CleanShot 2023-08-07 at 22 15 24](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_open-sauced_ai_assets_833231_6c681751-ec7d-44e5-90ec-3f6cee39edfa)

1. Navigate to a page where you’re using your extension.

1. If you want to debug or inspect the extension, click the _Inspect_ button from the Temporary Extensions section where the extension was just loaded.

1. You now have access to all the same browser dev tools you’re used to for debugging a web site, i.e. Inspect Element, CSS styles inspector, JavaScript debugger, etc.

And that’s it!
