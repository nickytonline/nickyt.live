On <time datetime="2021-01-21">January 21st</time>, DEV Community member Rafi joined Christina and I on the pairing stream to work on improving some accessibility issues in the onboarding for a Forem instance, e.g. DEV onboarding.

Here is the issue that we were working on.

{% github "https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/9585" %}

On this stream, we covered:

- accessibility issues currently affecting the onboarding process in a Forem instance
- we figured out why hyperlinks in labels were not focusable. Turns out setting the CSS property [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) with the value `contents` was the culprit. This was in the explanation of the usage of the `contents` value for the `display` CSS property in the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) docs -- _"Due to a bug in browsers this will currently remove the element from the accessibility tree â€” screen readers will not look at what's inside. See the Accessibility concerns section below for more details."_
- part of the fix was exploring part of codebase's SASS that was using [@extend](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend) as well as we were trying to figure out where a `margin-top` was being set.
- We had a bit of a setback with Rafi's web server dying for some reason, but we were still able to make do. That's the beauty of live coding. Unpredictable. ðŸ˜Ž
