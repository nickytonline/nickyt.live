Update 2019/06/30: Storybook now has an option via the CLI to install for Preact. For more info see [Preact for Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-preact).TLDR `npx -p @storybook/cli sb init --type preact`.

In my last Storybook post, [Getting Started with Storybook for React](https://dev.to/nickytonline/getting-started-with-react-storybook-9jh), I showed you how to install Storybook for React and gave a quick breakdown of what all the pieces were. I suggest giving that a quick read before continuing here.

In this post, Iâ€™ll show you how to get React Storybook up and running with Preact. The assumption is that the project you want to add [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to already has [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) installed as a dependency.

1. A temporary step is to first install React, so run `npm install react`
2. If you have npx installed, run `npx @storybook/cli` (most people should have this if youâ€™re on a newer version of node). If not run `npm install @storybook/cli -g`.
3. Next from the command line, run `getstorybook`
4. This will install all the dependencies you need to run Storybook.
5. Now letâ€™s uninstall `react` from our dependencies as we want to use preact!
6. Next we need to install [preact-compat](https://github.com/developit/preact-compat) so that Preact will play nicely with Storybook. If you need preact-compat as a dependency for other react libraries, install it to dependencies, `npm install preact-compat`. Otherwise install it as a dev depency, i.e. `npm install preact-compat -D`
7. Almost there!
8. The last thing we need to do is tell [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) (what Storybook uses under the hood), to use preact-compat. To do this, we need to create a custom webpack configuration file for Storybook. Lucky for us, Storybook supports this out of the box. In the root folder where your package.json file is, there will be a new folder called `.storybook`. In there it contains files related to Storybook configuration. Create a new file in there called `webpack.config.js` and paste the following contents and save the file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".js", "jsx"],
    alias: {
      react: "preact-compat",
      "react-dom": "preact-compat",
    },
  },
};
```

Note that this is a super bare bones webpack configuration. You can add anything else here you may need just like a regular webpack configuration file.

1. Storybook will create some demo stories for you found in the root folder of your app at `./stories/index.stories.js`
2. Open this file and remove the React reference and replace it with `import { h } from "preact";`
3. All thatâ€™s left to do is run `npm run storybook` and navigate to Storybook in a browser.

## Extras

- If you want to see an example of the final result, have a look at [my first commit to the dev.to repo](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/commit/6a8df8c8ddec739280325c0000d6d32593f70ed0) I made in March of this year.

- I havenâ€™t had time yet, but I was [discussing with the Storybook maintainers](https://dev.to/norbertdelangen/comment/4ccd) about potentially having a config for Preact out of the box.

Maybe Iâ€™ll get to it at some point, but if youâ€™re interested, by all means go for it. ðŸ™ƒ
