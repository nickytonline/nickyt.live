Continuing along with my [2018 Resolutions](https://dev.to/nickytonline/2018-resolutions-1deo) to make Code Pens this year, here is my latest. A super simple rating component showing how with just CSS you can go from 1 to 5 stars. I'll admit that there is nothing mind blowing in terms of what the pen does, but the point of it is to demonstrate a way to overcome the lack of previous sibling selector in CSS via Flexbox with row-reverse.

Here's last week's Code Pen, [Quick Hulk Code Pen](https://dev.to/nickytonline/quick-hulk-code-pen-18i1), if you wanna check it out.
