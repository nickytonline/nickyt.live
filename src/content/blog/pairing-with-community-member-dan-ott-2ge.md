On <time datetime="2021-02-03">February 3rd</time>, DEV Community member Dan Ott joined Christina and I on the pairing stream to work on a CSS issue related to Flexbox gap not being supported in Safari.

Here is the issue that we were working on:

### On this stream, we covered:

- Replacing flexbox with CSS grid in certain areas of the site so that grid gap could be used
- CSS grid features
- How awesome CSS is
