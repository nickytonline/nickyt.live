I’ve tweeted about this before, but one way I’ve been able to get engagement on old posts is to leverage dev.to’s series feature.

A perfect example of this is my [Year in Review](https://dev.to/nickytonline/series/3993) series.

![My dev.to notifications where people are bookmarking and liking previous posts from series of mine](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_n97rfjp41oejm2cimabg.png)

If you haven’t already, try out the series feature!
