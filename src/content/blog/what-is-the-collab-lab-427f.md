Curious about what [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/) is?

> The Collab Lab increases access to web development jobs for early-career developers and, in particular, people in under-represented groups in tech by providing experiential skills training in software team collaboration and career management.

â€“ Stacie Taylor, Engineering Team Lead at Zapier, Co-founder & mentor at The Collab Lab
