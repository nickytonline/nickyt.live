So I wrote about how Twitter is scrapping Revue.

I was able to pull down all my subscribers, as you can export them.

That is important, but I also wanted all my past newsletter issues. Revue has an API, so [I wrote a Deno script to save them](https://gist.github.com/nickytonline/102bb45e625db6b9ae0157e293cfb0a3).

This works great, but I was like, let's make this easier for folks who want to grab their newsletters and not have to worry about coding all this. So I wrote a small app to do it.

It uses a [Netlify function](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) written in TypeScript to grab the newsletter issues and good old HTML with some inlined style and inlined JavaScript.

Here's the source code if you're interested. It's all open source, MIT licensed.

If you have a Revue newsletter, try it out at [revue.iamdeveloper.com](https://revue.iamdeveloper.com). All you need to do is get a Revue API key. To get one, go to [https://www.getrevue.co/app/integrations](https://www.getrevue.co/app/integrations) and request one. It should be at the bottom of the page. It takes around 24 hours to get your API key.
