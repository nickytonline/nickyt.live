On <time datetime="2021-03-17">March 17th</time>, DEV Community member [Seth Hall](https://dev.to/sethburtonhall) joined [Christina](https://dev.to/coffeecraftcode) and I on the pairing stream to work on an issue related to image uploads in the editor.

Here is the issue that we were working on:

{% github "https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/12443" %}

### On this stream, we covered:

- **Debugging tools in the browser**, which helped us figure out why the image upload spinner wasn't displaying
- The inner workings of a Forem instance's article editor
- Why the image upload spinner was not appearing when an image was pasted or dragged and dropped
