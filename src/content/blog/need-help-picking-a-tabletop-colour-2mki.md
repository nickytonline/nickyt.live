Hey peeps, I'm gonna buy a motorized standing desk with some award points I got from work. Which colour top should I go with? Mind chiming in on the Twitter poll? üôè

Here is the desk, [MotionGrey Adjustable Dual Motors Electric Sit to Stand Computer Office Standing Desk](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/motiongrey-adjustable-dual-motors-electric-sit-to-stand-computer-office-standing-desk-grey-frame-white-table-top-included/13366716)

And here are the tabletop colours (both colours are in the Tweet. The liquid tag just doesn't show it).
