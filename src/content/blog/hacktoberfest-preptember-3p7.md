Whether you are new to Hacktoberfest or a seasoned veteran, welcome!

If you're new to Hacktoberfest or open source, don't fret! The community is here to support you! Worried about that first pull request (PR)? I was, too, when I first started contributing to open source. Turns out my first PR wasn't that great, but that's OK!

Whether you're new or not, I have you covered. I gave a talk in 2020 for Digital Ocean that is for maintainers and contributors, including first-time contributors.

I talk about [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) in that talk. If you're curious, I also gave a lightning talk about them.

My Virtual Coffee community also did a great Preptember stream that you should check out!
